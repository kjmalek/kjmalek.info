# Bio

I live in Vancouver, BC as an uninvited settler on the ancestral, unceded territories of the Musqueam people, and I frequently travel through the unceded territories of the Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh nations.

I'm currently working as a freelance digital asset manager/specialist and consultant with [RavenSpace](https://ravenspacepublishing.org).

In 2019, I earned my MLIS at the University of British Columbia, where I focused in knowledge organization and Indigenous initiatives in librarianship. I was also extraordinarily lucky to work as a Graduate Academic Assistant and co-op student in the X̱wi7x̱wa Library, where I assisted with technical services and collections management.
