# Bio

In 2019, I earned my MLIS at the University of British Columbia, where I focused my studies on metadata and cataloguing while also pursuing a First Nations Curriculum Concentration. I was also extraordinarily lucky to work as a Graduate Academic Assistant and co-op student in the [X̱wi7x̱wa Library](https://xwi7xwa.library.ubc.ca/), where I managed an inventory project and assisted with technical services.

Along with a brief stint as a Book Bike Ambassador with the [North Vancouver City Library](https://www.nvcl.ca/spokes-n-words-book-bike), I have spent the past few years working as a contractor with [RavenSpace Publishing](https://www.ravenspacepublishing.org/), where I have been consulting and developing documentation around topics like metadata, digital preservation, web performance, and platform administration related to applications like Scalar and DSpace.

When I'm not spending my time learning about new digital tools, I can be found wandering in the woods with my [wife](https://clairiel.com/) and our [wild dog](/images/majesticSadie.jpg).
