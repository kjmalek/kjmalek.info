# Hello there, internet folks!

Welcome to my personal site. It is very much a work-in-progress at the moment.

For those who don't know me, I'm a librarian and digital asset manager/specialist, who enjoys playing around with web development tools, scripting languages, and anything related to metadata. I also love to go for walks and hikes with my lovely wife and our spotted canine companion.

I look forward to exploring and sharing some of my interests with you all here in the digital world.
