# Hello there, internet folks!

Welcome to my personal site. It is very much a work-in-progress at the moment.

For those who don't know me, I'm a digital asset manager/specialist and librarian, who enjoys playing around with technology and learning new things with a focus on mastering the details and getting into the nitty-gritty. I also love to go for walks and hikes with my lovely fiance and wild canine companion.

I look forward to exploring and sharing some of my interests with you all here in the digital world.
